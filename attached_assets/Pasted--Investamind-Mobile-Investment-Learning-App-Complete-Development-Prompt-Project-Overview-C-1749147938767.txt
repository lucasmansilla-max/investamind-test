# Investamind Mobile Investment Learning App - Complete Development Prompt

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive mobile-first investment learning application called "Investamind" that teaches users about investing through structured modules, gamification, and real-time market integration. The app must be fully bilingual (English/Spanish) with language selection persisting throughout the entire user experience.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Language Support (CRITICAL)
- **Language Selection Modal**: On first app load, show a modal asking users to select their preferred language (English/Spanish)
- **Complete Localization**: ALL text, buttons, labels, notifications, content, and UI elements must be available in both languages
- **Language Persistence**: User's language choice must persist across sessions using localStorage
- **Dynamic Language Switching**: Include language toggle in settings/profile area
- **Spanish Translation Quality**: Ensure proper financial terminology and natural Spanish phrasing

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with modern hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first responsive design
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **State Management**: React Context for global state (language, user progress, etc.)
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage for user preferences and progress
- **API Integration**: Fetch real market data (use free tier APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance)

### 3. App Architecture & Navigation

### Language Context Setup
```javascript
// Create LanguageContext with translations object
const translations = {
  en: {
    dashboard: {
      title: "Dashboard",
      progress: "Your Learning Progress",
      completed: "Completed",
      totalModules: "Total Modules",
      dayStreak: "Day Streak",
      // ... all English translations
    }
  },
  es: {
    dashboard: {
      title: "Panel Principal",
      progress: "Tu Progreso de Aprendizaje",
